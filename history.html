	  <p>In the English version, Māori cede the sovereignty of New Zealand to Britain; 
	  Māori give the Crown an exclusive right to buy lands they wish to sell and, in return, 
	  are guaranteed full rights of ownership of their possessions; and Māori are given the rights and privileges of British subjects. 
	  <br><br>There are some important differences in translation. 
	  Most significantly, in the Māori version the word ‘sovereignty’ was translated as ‘kawanatanga’ (governance).
	  The English version guaranteed ‘undisturbed possession’ of all properties, but the Māori version guaranteed ‘tino rangatiratanga’ 
	  (full authority) over ‘taonga’ (treasures, which can be intangible).</p>

	  <p>The status of the Treaty has evolved over time. <br>
	  Unlike many other countries, New Zealand does not have a constitution in the form of a single document. It has a collection of common laws, 
	  customs and legislation that establish the framework of government. 
	  <br><br>The Treaty was the initial agreement that established British authority. 
	  This authority was later transferred to the New Zealand Parliament. Māori leaders and people have stressed the Treaty’s importance ever since. 
	  <br>In recent history, successive governments have recognised the significance of the Treaty in the life of the nation.</p>

  		<p>New Zealand was changing quickly in the late 1830s. British subjects and other Europeans were acquiring land from Māori 
  		and had set up valuable commercial operations. Large groups of settlers had set out for New Zealand in 1839. 
  		Crime, violence and general lawlessness was rife, and the British Resident from 1833, James Busby, could do little to control it. 
  		<br><br>Foreign powers, notably the French, were also taking an interest in New Zealand. <br>The British government appointed 
  		Captain William Hobson as consul and provided him with instructions to negotiate for the sovereignty of 
  		New Zealand and for the setting up of a British colony.</p>

	  <p>Shortly after the Treaty was signed, Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson proclaimed British sovereignty over the whole of New Zealand. 
	  His proclamations were ratified by the British government in October 1840. Under British law, 
	  New Zealand became technically a part of the colony of New South Wales. Further constitutional changes in late 1840 and early 1841 
	  made New Zealand a Crown colony in its own right.</p>
