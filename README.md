A tourism website about New Zealand I had to make for a course assignment in 2018

This website was one of the earlier assignments I had to do, which is why it is static and does not have and PHP or SQL code in it. We were asked to make a website "about New Zealand" and were only given a handful of specific requirements. We had to include information about the Treaty of Waitangi, upcoming events, and attractions. The rest was up to us.
The grade awarded for this assignment was an A+ (94%).
Enjoy!
